<h2>Naming of things</h2>
<p>I like magpies. I've seen a lot of them while living in Durham, England. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie#Europe">According to Wikipedia</a>, “In England, "a magpie’s nest" was a phrase used to describe something untidy and usually of little value.”</p>
<p>That seems as good a reason to name your personal blog Magpie as any.</p>
