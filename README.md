# Maureen Holland, Personal Site

## Overview

Dependencies make a lot of sense for a lot of cases, but this is not one of them.

I want a personal site with no dependencies. It's just me. I don't update it very often. I have no intention of scaling this any further than one developer who hates updating dependencies.

It's a front-end playground. Occasional blog ramblings.

## Tools

HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Maybe someday I'll write a shell script to optimize images, but that day is not today.

### VS Code

I searched for how to get automatic refresh on file changes and found this article: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vscode-live-server-auto-refresh-browser/

VS Code has a Live Server extension :tada: It works great.

### Josefin Sans

I wanted to use a [variable font](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/) and luckily my favourite font, Josefin Sans, has a "Weight" axis: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans

It has an SIL Open Font License (full text in the `/fonts/OFT.txt` file)
