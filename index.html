    <h1>Maureen Holland</h1>
    <h2>Writer & Web Developer</h2>
    <p>I'm a front-end developer that can go full-stack in a pinch. I own a small collection of library cards: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Cambridge, and Durham. You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/maureenlholland">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@maureenholland">Mastodon</a>. Longer form ramblings can be found on the <a href="/magpie">Magpie</a> blog.</p>
