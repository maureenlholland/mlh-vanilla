            <description>I rebuild my personal site every few years. This time, I decided I

            <description>This is a catch-all post for a bunch of miscellaneous updates I've
          been meaning to do since last April: rel=me, microformatting, RSS, and
          garden bird themes.</description>

            <description>I have mixed thoughts on International Women's Day, perhaps best encapsulated by the gender pay gap bot that notes discrepancies between a company's social media messages and real-world actions.</description>

            <description>I used to have Tim Gunn's catchphrase in my head during CSS development.

            <description>I've seen a huge benefit in switching from selector-based to inheritance-based theming at work. CSS custom properties have been the key to unlocking a more flexible and scalable system.</description>

            <description>I’ve watched my sister put out a beautiful display of perfectly non-choke-able sized toys and games for her 18-month-old child to play with. Know what the Kid does?</description>
