          This is a catch-all post for a bunch of miscellaneous updates I've
          been meaning to do since last April.

        <h2>What's the IndieWeb?</h2>
        <blockquote>
          The IndieWeb is a community of independent and personal websites
          connected by simple standards, based on the principles of: owning your
          domain and using it as your primary identity, publishing on your own
          site (optionally syndicating elsewhere), and owning your data.
          <footer>
            <cite><a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb: Home</a></cite>
          </footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I bought my domain on <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a> in
          2016. It costs $15.99 USD per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> for hosting
          because it's free and convenient (but I've had good experiences with
          <a href="https://www.greengeeks.com/">GreenGeeks</a> in the past and
          would definitely go back if I decide I want to pay for hosting again).
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, that's it! I've been IndieWeb for years without knowing!
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that you can build the site however the heck
          you want. There's no need to avoid dependencies like the plague (a
          personal preference of mine). But now I know I've got the essentials
          covered, I also want to add a few of the optional features mentioned
          in their
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a>
          page.
        </p>
        <h2><code>rel="me"</code></h2>
        <p>
          It's not too hard to consider this site as my primary identity because
          I abandoned Facebook and Twitter years ago. I do exist on Mastodon
          though, and wanted to figure out how to get the green background and
          checkmark on my Mastodon profile for my personal homepage link.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The problem:</strong> there was no indication from my personal
          site that my social Mastodon link was representing <em>me</em> instead
          of some other Mastodon user.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The fix:</strong> add <code>rel="me"</code> to my homepage
          social link.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/rel-me-markup.png"
            alt="Firefox DevTools open to inspect anchor element with 'Mastodon' text. Focus around 'rel=me' attribute in markup."
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <figcaption>Personal homepage Mastodon link</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I then needed to remove and re-add the field in Mastodon to trigger a
          verification check with the new markup.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="../images/rel-me-website.png"
            alt="Fields in Mastodon profile. Joined: Mar 07, 2023. GitHub: github.com/maureenlholland (not verified). Pronouns: she/her. Personal Site: maureenholland.ca (verified!). Employer: silverorange.com"
            loading="lazy"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Mastodon profile with verified personal homepage link
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I live for small victories.</p>
        <p>
          So I decided to verify my GitHub link as well. This involved heading
          to my GitHub page and editing the profile to add my Mastodon social
          link (no need for <code>rel="me"</code> in the GitHub profile,
          although it's a good idea to include it on your personal site GitHub
          URL). One remove/re-add field link dance on Mastodon later and I had
          doubled my number of verified links.
        </p>

          <img
            src="../images/gh-social-link.png"
            alt="Fields in Mastodon profile, now with both Personal Site and GitHub links verified."
            loading="lazy"
          />

        <h2>Microformatting</h2>
        <blockquote>
          This will allow other people's software to easily read and understand
          your content. This is useful for a variety of things like recognizing
          comments, likes, reposts, and displaying reply-contexts for your
          posts.
          <footer>
            <cite
              ><a
                href="https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started#Add_microformats_to_your_content"

              ></cite
            >
          </footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Now, am I using any of this interactive potential at the moment? Nope.
          The addition of microformatting was more of an academic exercise than
          a practical one. I wanted to see if my understanding matched the
          <a
            href="https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmaureenholland.ca%2Fmagpie%2Fa-vanilla-personal-site"
            >validator results</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>It was a semi-success. The following information was validated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>Date Published</li>
          <li>Content</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But then there were a bunch of gaps for information I hadn't included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Author</li>
          <li>Canonicial URL</li>
          <li>Syndicated Copies</li>
          <li>Categories</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whoops. Fairly easy to add the Author and Canonical URL info. I might
          use categories in future but am waiting to see if I manage more than
          one post a year first. Syndicated copies are cool (<a
            href="https://indiewebify.me/validate-h-entry/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadactio.com%2F"
            >see an example from Jeremy Keith here</a
          >), but again, a future me implementation.
        </p>
        <h2>RSS</h2>
        <blockquote>
          Using an RSS reader is a little like using Twitter or Facebook, but
          where you’re totally in control. It’s the same in that you have a
          stream of the latest content. But unlike those platforms, RSS is
          decentralised. Nobody gets all of that data in one place, so nobody
          can use it to nudge your behaviour.
          <footer>
            <cite
              ><a

        <p>
          RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary. It's
          the specification that brought us podcasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became a big fan of RSS after reading
          <a href="https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2023-02-23-investing-in-rss/"
            >Tim Kadlec's "Investing in RSS" post</a
          >. Since then, I've been cultivating a little blog garden of knowledge
          that I read when I have time or need inspiration. Before, I would
          haphazardly subscribe to newsletters and leave them to die unread
          deaths in my email inbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I wanted to include a feed on my blog, but I didn't know how to
          make one without a plugin. That seems a bit of a counter-argument to
          the "Really Simple" promise of its acronym.
        </p>
        <p>
          My searches for "How to make an RSS Feed" returned more results about
          pulling from an existing site instead of creating a feed on the site
          itself. Adding to the confusion is the fact a lot of "RSS" is really
          "Atom", a separate XML-based specification. I decided to start with
          the most basic RSS feed I could get away with. It's linked in the
          <code>head</code> and available to view in all its unstyled glory from
          the <code>footer</code>.

        <h2>Garden Bird Themes</h2>
        <p>
          This has nothing to do with the IndieWeb but I love Max Bock's Mario
          Kart themes and wanted to do something similar here.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose birds based on what I remembered seeing in our garden in the
          UK.

        <h2>Good Enough</h2>
        <p>
          Oh boy, hardest part of writing a blog post is definitely deciding
          when it's done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been fussing with this thing since Christmas and finally realized
          it was never going to be exactly what I wanted it to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, good enough is enough. I'm not a multi-tasker. I have to
          finish a thing before moving onto the next. And it's time to start the
          next thing.
